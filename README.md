# Leave-Management-App
Build the front-end of a small Leave Management System for internal HR use. Employees can apply for leave, managers can view and approve them, and both can see leave balances.

Perfect! Here's an expanded and detailed **Employee Leave Management App Specification** with clearly defined **features, user stories, UI expectations, and testing scenarios** ‚Äî just like you'd get in a real-world assessment or project.

# üìù **Project Specification: Employee Leave Management App (Angular)**

---

## üìå Project Title: `leave-manager`

## üë§ Users:

1. **Employee** (can apply for leave, view history and balances)
2. **Manager/Admin** (can view and approve/reject leaves)

---

## üîß Technologies:

* Angular 15+
* Angular Material (or TailwindCSS if preferred)
* Reactive Forms
* RxJS (`BehaviorSubject` or Signals)
* Routing + Guards
* LocalStorage or JSON server (for persistence)
* Jasmine + Karma (or Jest) for testing

---

## üß± Functional Requirements (User Stories):

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Apply for Leave**

```gherkin
As an employee,
I want to apply for leave using a form,
So that HR can review and approve my request.
```

**Form Fields:**

* Leave Type: Dropdown (Vacation, Sick, Study, Maternity, etc.)
* Start Date
* End Date
* Reason

**Validation Rules:**

* End Date > Start Date
* Max 20 days total
* Reason required

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **View Leave History**

```gherkin
As an employee,
I want to see all my leave requests,
So I can track their status and history.
```

* Display leave list in a **table** with columns:

  * Date Range
  * Leave Type
  * Status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
  * Action (View/Cancel if Pending)
* Add filters by leave type and status
* Add pagination or virtual scroll

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Leave Balance Summary**

```gherkin
As an employee,
I want to see how many leave days I have left,
So I can plan ahead.
```

* Show leave balances per leave type
* Use cards or bar chart (e.g., Angular Material + Chart.js)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Approve or Reject Leave (Manager Only)**

```gherkin
As a manager,
I want to approve or reject employee leave requests,
So I can manage resources.
```

* Route: `/admin`
* List of all pending requests
* Click Approve/Reject (trigger confirmation dialog/snackbar)
* Update status instantly

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Authentication Simulation**

* Use a simple hardcoded switch in a service to simulate login

```ts
isManager = true; // simulate logged-in manager
```

* Use a route guard for `/admin`

---
